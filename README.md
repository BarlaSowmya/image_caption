# Image Captioning with Deep Learning
This repository contains an implementation of an image captioning model using deep learning techniques. The model generates captions for images by combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sequence generation. The project utilizes the Flickr8k dataset for training and evaluation.
# Table of Contents
# 1.Installation
To get started with the project, follow the steps below to install the required dependencies.
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-captioning.git
cd image-captioning
# 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed, then install the required dependencies by running:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

# The dependencies include:

1.TensorFlow 
2.Keras
3.NumPy
4.Matplotlib
5.Pillow
6.tqdm
7.scikit-learn
8.joblib

# 3.Usage
# Data Preparation
Download the Flickr8k dataset (images and captions) from Flickr8k Dataset.
Extract the data and place the images in a directory (/content/flickr8k/Images/) and the captions in a text file (/content/flickr8k/captions.txt).
# Preprocessing
The following steps will preprocess the images and captions:

Extract image features using a pre-trained VGG16 model (without the top layers).
Tokenize the captions and prepare them for training.
# 4.Model Training
To train the image captioning model, run the following:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py
This will:

Load the preprocessed image features and captions.
Train the model on the provided data.
Save the trained model to a file.
# 5.Model Inference
After training, you can generate captions for new images by running the following:

bash
python generate_caption.py --image_path path_to_image.jpg
This will generate a caption for the given image using the trained model.

# 6.Model Architecture
The image captioning model is composed of two main parts:

# CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):

A pre-trained VGG16 model (without the top layers) is used to extract features from the input images.
The output of the CNN is a 4096-dimensional feature vector that represents each image.
# RNN (Recurrent Neural Network):

The feature vector from the CNN is passed to an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network.
The LSTM generates the sequence of words (caption) based on the image features.

# 7.The architecture of the model can be summarized as:

Input: Image features (from CNN) and a sequence of words (from captions).
Output: Predicted words (caption).
Trainingraining Data: The model is trained using the Flickr8k dataset, with 8091 images and corresponding captions.
Epochs: 20
Batch Size: 64
Optimizer: Adam
Loss Function: Sparse categorical cross-entropy
After training, the model is saved as a .h5 file, which can be loaded for inference.

# 8.Results
The model generates captions for images with good accuracy.
The vocabulary size is 4426 words, and the maximum sequence length is 38.
Example output:

Input Image:
Predicted Caption: "A dog playing in the grass."
